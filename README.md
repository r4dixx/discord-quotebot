## 👨‍💻 Available commands

There are two types of commands. 

The most basic are available to everyone:

- Get a random quote → `/quote`
- Save a quote → `/save` your_quote
- Display help message → `/help`
- Test → `/ping`

The more advanced (i.e. touchy) commands are available to selected users called "captains". I called this privilege level that way to avoid any confusion with the term "server admins". Captains are not server admins, server admins are not captains. Anyway, these are the commands:

- Edit last saved quote → `/edit` `last` new_quote
- Edit chosen quote → `/edit` `item` old_quote new_quote
- Delete last saved quote → `/delete` `last`
- Delete chosen quote → `/delete` `item` quote_to_delete

All these commands can be customized in [commands.json](src/config/commands.json)

## 🏁 Preliminary steps

1. [Create a new Discord app](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and give it a fancy name.

2. In the OAuth2 settings, set the scope to `application.commands`, open the generated link and add the bot to your server.

2. Grab [the latest release](https://github.com/r4dixx/discord-quotebot/releases/latest)

3. Return to your app settings in the developer portal and open [src/config/private.json](src/config/private.json):

    - Copy/paste your OAuth2 client ID in the `client` field.

    - Add a bot in the bot section and copy/paste its token in the `token` field.
    
    - Copy/paste your guild ID and user ID in the appropriate fields (`server` and `captains`). Check [the official support page](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/articles/206346498) for more info.

      > This will give you more rights (edition, deletion, etc).  
      You can add as many captains as you'd like but I recommend you tread carefully.
      Keep it minimal.

   - **Immediately** run `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/config/private.json` to avoid sharing this file with anyone.

### Important notes

- Users declared as captains of this bot **are not** server admins. The opposite applies too.
- **Never** EVER share your `private.json` file content. [See why](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#token-leak-scenario).
- If you're lost, see [the official documentation](https://discordjs.guide).

## ⚙️ Customization

Edit  [commands.json](src/config/commands.json) and customize it to your likings

> **Warning**: Some prefix/commands can cause conflicts with other bots!

## 🏗 Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) **16.6 or higher** installed.

```sh
$ cd discord-quotebot
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## 🧪 Test if everything is up and running

Send `/ping` in your Discord server and see the magic happen
